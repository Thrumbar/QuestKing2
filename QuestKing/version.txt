2.2.4
- Fixed a bug with PetTracker integration where the pet zone tracker would frequently reappear even when disabled.
- Added an option to hide the border of the mode toggle buttons (opt.hideToggleButtonBorder, false by default).

- Fixed bug with bonus objective display (caused by 6.2 patch).
- Fixed bug related to new text format for some reputation objectives (caused by 6.2 patch).

2.2.1
- Attempted to fix a bug which happened sometimes when multiple bonus objectives were displayed at the same time.

- Slightly increased the time bonus rewards are displayed from 7 to 10 seconds.

- Changed supertracking to always check for the closest POI when accepting a quest.
